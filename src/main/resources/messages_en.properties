help.csv.title=How should the CSV file be formatted?
help.csv.description=The file must contain two columns, one for each group (e.g., control and experiment).<br>The first row may contain a project title (in a single cell).<br>The second row may contain column headers.<br>Empty cells are allowed.<br><br>Example:<br>Effect of mindfulness<br>Control,Experiment<br>10,23<br>11,1<br>15,23

help.tests.title=Which statistical test should I choose?
help.tests.description=T-Test: Compare means between two groups (assumes normal distribution).<br>Welch: If the groups have unequal variances.<br>Paired T-test: For related measurements.<br>Mann-Whitney: When the data is not normally distributed.<br>Wilcoxon: Non-parametric for paired data.<br>ANOVA: For comparing three or more groups.

help.hypothesis.title=What is hypothesis testing?
help.hypothesis.description=Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that helps you determine whether an observed difference in data is due to chance or a real effect.
