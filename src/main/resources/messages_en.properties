app.title=Simple Significance
app.tagline=Simple, guided hypothesis testing.
app.description=Simple Significance is a free web-based tool for exploratory hypothesis testing. It is designed for students, teachers, and anyone curious about basic data analysis. The app helps you compare group differences using statistical significance tests - without requiring advanced prior knowledge of statistics.
app.note=Note: This tool is not intended to replace professional software like SPSS or R. The results are not meant for professional use, and accuracy is not guaranteed.

help.hypothesis.title=What is hypothesis testing?
help.hypothesis.description=Hypothesis testing is a method used to decide whether a difference observed in data is likely to be real, or just due to chance.<br><br>When performing a hypothesis test, you start with a <b>null hypothesis</b> ? usually that there is no difference between the groups. The goal is to determine whether your data provides enough evidence to reject this null hypothesis.<br><br><b>Example:</b> Suppose you want to test whether drinking coffee improves reaction time. You ask 30 friends to measure their reaction time in a simple online test before and after drinking a cup of coffee. You save the results in a CSV file with two columns ? ?Before coffee? and ?After coffee? ? and upload it here. The app will then help you decide if the difference is statistically significant.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Statistical results are only reliable with enough data. You should have at least 15 participants in each group. 30 or more per group is recommended.<br><br><b>Important:</b> This tool does not control for confounding variables. For example, if people were more alert because they were competing with friends, that could affect the result.

help.tests.title=Which statistical test should I choose?
help.tests.description=A significance test checks whether a difference between groups is large enough that it's unlikely to be caused by random variation. This app includes a small set of commonly used tests:<br><br><b>T-Test:</b> Compare means between two groups (assumes normal distribution and equal variance).<br><b>Welch's T-Test:</b> Like T-Test but for unequal variances.<br><b>Paired T-Test:</b> Use for paired data (e.g., before/after measurements).<br><b>Mann-Whitney U:</b> Non-parametric alternative when data isn't normally distributed.<br><b>Wilcoxon:</b> Non-parametric test for paired data.<br><b>ANOVA:</b> For comparing three or more groups with normal distribution and equal variance.<br><br><b>Note:</b> The app will recommend one or more tests based on your data.

help.csv.title=How should the CSV file be formatted?
help.csv.description=A CSV file is a simple text file where values are separated by commas. You can create one using any spreadsheet program (like Excel or LibreOffice Calc) by entering your data and using 'Save As...' -> '.csv'.<br><br>You can also create a CSV manually using Notepad or any text editor. Each column should represent a group. The first row may contain a project title, and the second row the column headers (group names).<br><br>More than two groups are allowed - the app will recommend the appropriate test based on the number of groups and your data.<br><br><b>Example CSV file:</b><br><pre>Effect of mindfulness<br>Control,Experiment<br>10,23<br>11,1<br>15,23<br>(etc.)</pre>
