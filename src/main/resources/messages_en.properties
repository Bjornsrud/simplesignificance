app.title=Simple Significance
app.tagline=Simple, guided hypothesis testing.
app.description=Simple Significance is a free web-based tool for exploratory hypothesis testing. It is designed for students, teachers, and anyone curious about basic data analysis. The app helps you compare group differences using statistical significance tests ? without requiring advanced prior knowledge of statistics.
app.note=Note: This tool is not intended to replace professional software like SPSS or R. The results are not meant for professional use, and accuracy is not guaranteed.

help.hypothesis.title=What is hypothesis testing?
help.hypothesis.description=Hypothesis testing is a statistical method for assessing whether observed differences between groups are likely due to chance or reflect a real effect. It has long been used in research, medicine, education, and many other fields.<br><br>Example: Suppose a teacher wants to test whether a new learning app improves student scores. The teacher could divide students into two groups, one using the app and one not, and compare their exam scores. This application would help assess whether the score difference is statistically significant.<br><br>Try it yourself! Ask at least 30 friends or classmates to report how many hours they sleep on weekdays versus weekends. Save their answers as a CSV file with two columns ? ?Weekdays? and ?Weekends? ? and upload it here to analyze the difference.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Statistical results are only reliable with enough data. You should have at least 15 participants in each group. 30 or more per group is recommended.<br><br><b>Important:</b> This tool does not control for confounding variables. If something else differs between your groups, it may affect the results.

help.tests.title=Which statistical test should I choose?
help.tests.description=A significance test checks whether a difference between groups is large enough that it?s unlikely to be caused by random variation. This app includes a small set of commonly used tests:<br><br><b>T-Test:</b> Compare means between two groups (assumes normal distribution and equal variance).<br><b>Welch?s T-Test:</b> Like T-Test but for unequal variances.<br><b>Paired T-Test:</b> Use for paired data (e.g., before/after measurements).<br><b>Mann-Whitney U:</b> Non-parametric alternative when data isn?t normally distributed.<br><b>Wilcoxon:</b> Non-parametric test for paired data.<br><b>ANOVA:</b> For comparing three or more groups with normal distribution and equal variance.<br><br><b>Note:</b> The app will recommend one or more tests based on your data.

help.csv.title=How should the CSV file be formatted?
help.csv.description=A CSV file is a simple text file where values are separated by commas. You can create one using any spreadsheet program (like Excel or LibreOffice Calc) by entering your data and using ?Save As?? > ?CSV?.<br><br>You can also create a CSV manually using Notepad or any text editor. Each column should represent a group. The first row may contain a project title, and the second row the column headers (group names).<br><br>More than two groups are allowed ? the app will recommend the appropriate test based on the number of groups and your data.<br><br><b>Example CSV file:</b><br><pre>Effect of mindfulness<br>Control,Experiment<br>10,23<br>11,1<br>15,23</pre>
