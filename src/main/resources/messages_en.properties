app.title=Simple Significance
app.tagline=Simple, guided hypothesis testing.
app.description=Simple Significance is a free web-based tool for exploratory hypothesis testing. It is designed for students, teachers, and anyone curious about basic data analysis. The app helps you compare group differences using statistical significance tests - without requiring advanced prior knowledge of statistics.
app.note=Note: This tool is not intended to replace professional software like SPSS or R. The results are not meant for professional use, and accuracy is not guaranteed.

form.pairedCheckbox=These groups are paired (e.g., before/after)
form.pairedNote=This option only applies if your CSV contains exactly two groups. It will be ignored otherwise.
form.pairedUserNote=You have stated that these groups are paired.
form.pairedTooManyGroups=Note: This setting will be ignored because the dataset contains more than two groups.

form.chooseFile=Choose file
form.noFileChosen=No file chosen
form.label=Please upload a CSV file with two or more columns:
form.button=Upload and analyze
form.startAnalysis=Start analysis

project.parsedData=Project Data
project.title=Project Title:
project.upload.success=The file \"{0}\" was successfully uploaded.
project.upload.error=Failed to read the uploaded file.
project.upload.missing=No file selected. Please choose a valid CSV file.

help.hypothesis.title=What is hypothesis testing?
help.hypothesis.description=Hypothesis testing is a method used to decide whether a difference observed in data is likely to reflect real differences between groups, or are likely to be just due to chance.<br><br><b>Example:</b> Suppose you want to test whether drinking coffee improves reaction time. You ask 30 people to measure their reaction time in a simple online test before and after drinking a cup of coffee. You save the results in a CSV file with two columns \u2013 \u201CBefore coffee\u201D and \u201CAfter coffee\u201D \u2013 and upload it here. The app will then help you decide if the difference is statistically significant.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Statistical results are only reliable with enough data. You should have at least 15 participants in each group. 30 or more per group is recommended.<br><br><b>Important:</b> This tool does not control for <b>confounding variables</b>. If something else differs between your groups, it may affect the results. For example, performing a reaction test once can serve as practice, making you better the second time, regardless of whether you've had coffee.

help.tab.basics=Basics of Hypothesis Testing
help.tab.basics.title=Basics of Hypothesis Testing
help.tab.basics.description=Hypothesis testing is used to evaluate whether observed differences between groups are likely due to chance or reflect a real effect. You always start with a <b>null hypothesis</b> \u2013 usually that there is no difference between the groups. Then you use a statistical test to determine whether the data supports rejecting this.<br><br>In statistics, two groups can be either independent or paired. <b>Paired data</b> means each value in one group corresponds directly to a value in the other \u2013 for example, the same individuals measured before and after an intervention. Some tests are designed specifically for paired data, such as the Paired T-Test and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. These tests should only be used if the measurements are truly related.<br><br>Another important concept is <b>skewness</b>, which describes how symmetrical the distribution of your data is. Strong skewness can make some tests less reliable, even if the data appears roughly normal at first glance.<br><br>It's also important to consider assumptions about the data: whether it's <b>normally distributed</b>, and whether the <b>variance</b> is similar between groups. The app checks these properties automatically and recommends suitable tests accordingly.<br><br>If you want to learn more about hypothesis testing and statistical analysis, we recommend this clear beginner-friendly guide from Scribbr:<br><a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Statistical Analysis &ndash; 5 Steps & Examples</b></a>

help.tests.title=Which statistical test should I choose?
help.tests.description=A significance test checks whether a difference between groups is large enough that it\u2019s unlikely to be caused by random variation. This app includes a small set of commonly used tests:<br><br><b>T-Test:</b> Compare means between two groups (assumes normal distribution and equal variance).<br><b>Welch\u2019s T-Test:</b> Like T-Test but for unequal variances.<br><b>Paired T-Test:</b> Use for paired data (e.g., before/after measurements).<br><b>Mann-Whitney U:</b> Non-parametric alternative when data isn\u2019t normally distributed.<br><b>Wilcoxon:</b> Non-parametric test for paired data.<br><b>ANOVA:</b> For comparing three or more groups with normal distribution and equal variance.<br><br><b>Note:</b> The app will recommend one appropriate test based on your data.

help.csv.title=How should the CSV file be formatted?
help.csv.description=A CSV file is a simple text file where values are separated by commas. You can create one using any spreadsheet program (like Excel or LibreOffice Calc) by entering your data and using \u201CSave As...\u201D \u2192 \u201C.csv\u201D.<br><br>You can also create a CSV manually using Notepad or any text editor. Each column should represent a group. The first row may contain a project title, and the second row the column headers (group names).<br><br>More than two groups are allowed \u2013 the app will recommend the appropriate test based on the number of groups and your data.<br><br><b>Example CSV file:</b><br><pre>Effect of mindfulness<br>Control,Experiment<br>10,23<br>11,1<br>15,23<br>(etc.)</pre>
