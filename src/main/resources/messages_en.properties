app.title=Simple Significance
app.tagline=Simple, guided hypothesis testing.
app.description=Simple Significance is a free web-based tool for exploratory hypothesis testing. It is designed for students, teachers, and anyone curious about basic data analysis. The app helps you compare group differences using statistical significance tests - without requiring advanced prior knowledge of statistics.
app.note=Note: This tool is not intended to replace professional software like SPSS or R. The results are not meant for professional use, and accuracy is not guaranteed.

form.pairedCheckbox=These groups are paired (e.g., before/after)
form.pairedNote=This option only applies if your CSV contains exactly two groups. It will be ignored otherwise.
form.pairedUserNote=You have stated that these groups are paired.
form.pairedTooManyGroups=Note: This setting will be ignored because the dataset contains more than two groups.

form.chooseFile=Choose file
form.noFileChosen=No file chosen
form.label=Please upload a CSV file with two or more columns:
form.button=Upload and analyze
form.startAnalysis=Start analysis

project.parsedData=Project Data
project.title=Project Title:
project.upload.success=The file \"{0}\" was successfully uploaded.
project.upload.error=Failed to read the uploaded file.
project.upload.missing=No file selected. Please choose a valid CSV file.

help.hypothesis.title=What is a hypothesis?
help.hypothesis.description=A hypothesis is a testable statement about the relationship between two or more variables. It offers a specific prediction that can be examined through data collection and analysis. Hypothesis testing is a core part of the scientific method, helping us determine whether an observed effect reflects a real pattern or is simply due to chance. <br><br>A hypothesis is usually based on prior research or observation and is always tested against a <b>null hypothesis</b>, which assumes no meaningfull relationship between the variables we are measuring.<br><br><b>Example:</b> <br>A researcher might ask, "Does sleep deprivation affect test performance?" <br>The hypothesis could then be: <i>People who are sleep-deprived will perform worse on a test than people who are well-rested.</i><br><br>To test this hypothesis, participants can be randomly assigned to two groups: one allowed to sleep normally, the other woken up early. Both groups are then given a task they haven't practiced. Their performance is recorded and compared using a statistical significance test to assess whether any observed difference is a likely result of our manipulation.<br><br>The result does not only describe this single study but may reveal broader patterns that can inform future research.

help.tab.basics=Fundamental Terms
help.tab.basics.title=Basic Concepts
help.tab.basics.description=To interpret the results of a hypothesis test, it's important to understand a few basic concepts. These help determine which test is appropriate and how results should be understood.<br><br><b>Independent vs. paired groups:</b> In <i>paired</i> data, each value in one group corresponds directly to a value in the other (e.g., before/after measurements on the same person). <i>Independent</i> groups consist of different individuals with no such link.<br><br><b>Independent variable:</b> The variable that is manipulated in an experiment (e.g., sleep deprivation).<br><br><b>Dependent variable:</b> The outcome that is measured (e.g., test performance).<br><br><b>P-Value:</b> The p-value is the probability that the observed effect within the study could have occurred by chance if, in reality, there is no true effect of our manipulation. A p-value of 0.05 means a 5 per cent chance that the observed differences between groups are due to chance. <br><br><b>Normal distribution:</b> Many tests assume the data follows a bell-shaped curve centered around the mean.<br><br><b>Variance:</b> A measure of how spread out the values are. Unequal variance across groups may affect which tests are valid.<br><br><b>Skewness:</b> Indicates how asymmetrical the data is. High skewness can reduce the reliability of certain tests.<br><br>The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine whether differences in the data are large enough to be considered <i>statistically significant</i> - meaning they are unlikely to have occurred by chance alone.

help.tests.title=Which statistical test should I choose?
help.tests.description=A significance test checks whether a difference between groups is large enough that it\u2019s unlikely to be caused by random variation. This app includes a small set of commonly used tests:<br><br><b>T-Test:</b> Compare means between two groups (assumes normal distribution and equal variance).<br><br><b>Welch\u2019s T-Test:</b> Like T-Test but for unequal variances.<br><br><b>Paired T-Test:</b> Use for paired data (e.g., before/after measurements).<br><br><b>Mann-Whitney U:</b> Non-parametric alternative when data isn\u2019t normally distributed.<br><br><b>Wilcoxon:</b> Non-parametric test for paired data.<br><br><b>ANOVA:</b> For comparing three or more groups with normal distribution and equal variance.<br><br>The app will recommend one appropriate test based on your data.

help.csv.title=How should the CSV file be formatted?
help.csv.description=A CSV file is a simple text file where values are separated by commas. You can create one using any spreadsheet program (like Excel or LibreOffice Calc) by entering your data and using \u201CSave As...\u201D \u2192 \u201C.csv\u201D.<br><br>You can also create a CSV manually using Notepad or any text editor. Each column should represent a group. The first row may contain a project title, and the second row the column headers (group names).<br><br>More than two groups are allowed \u2013 the app will recommend the appropriate test based on the number of groups and your data.<br><br><b>Example CSV file:</b><br><pre>Effect of mindfulness<br>Control,Experiment<br>10,23<br>11,1<br>15,23<br>(etc.)</pre>
