# Simple Significance

**Simple, guided hypothesis testing.**

Simple Significance is a lightweight statistics web application built with Spring Boot and Java. It is a free, web-based tool for exploratory hypothesis testing ‚Äî designed for anyone curious about basic data analysis, but most of all, for me to relearn a bit about statistics after not having thouched the subject at all since my master thesis research project back in 2013. :)

The app helps you compare group differences using statistical significance tests ‚Äì without requiring advanced prior knowledge of statistics.

> üîç *Note: This tool is not intended to replace professional software like SPSS or R. The results are not meant for professional use, and accuracy is not guaranteed.*
